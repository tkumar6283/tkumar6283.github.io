       <p>Roshan was <dfn>originally scheduled to make his screen debut as a lead actor opposite Preity Zinta in the cancelled film Shekhar Kapur's Tara Rum Pum Pum.[23] Instead, he starred in his father's romantic drama Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000) opposite another debutante, Ameesha Patel. Roshan played dual roles: Rohit, an aspiring singer brutally killed after witnessing a murder, and Raj, an NRI who falls in love with Patel's character.[24] To prepare, he trained with the actor Salman Khan to bulk up physically,[25] worked to improve his diction and took lessons in acting, singing, dancing, fencing and riding.[26] With global revenues of ₹620 million (US$8.7 million),[27] Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai became the highest-grossing Indian film of 2000.[28] His performance was acclaimed by critics;[20][29] Suggu Kanchana on Rediff.com wrote, "[Roshan] is good. The ease and style with which he dances, emotes, fights, makes one forget this is his debut film ... He seems to be the most promising among the recent lot of star sons we have been subjected to</dfn>."[24] For the role, Roshan received Best Male Debut and Best Actor Awards at the annual Filmfare Awards, IIFA Awards, and Zee Cine Awards.[30] He became the first actor to win both Filmfare Best Debut and Best Actor awards the same year.[31] The film established Roshan as a prominent actor in Bollywood.[32] The actor found life hard after his overnight success, particularly the demands on his time.[33]

In his second release, Khalid Mohammed's crime drama Fiza, Roshan played Amaan, an innocent Muslim boy who becomes a terrorist after the 1992–93 Bombay riots.[33] Roshan appeared in the film to expand his horizons as an actor.[34] Co-starring Karisma Kapoor and Jaya Bachchan, Fiza was moderately successful at the box office,[35] and Roshan's performance earned him a second nomination for Best Actor at the Filmfare ceremony.[36] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama praised him as the production's prime asset, commending his "body language, his diction, his expressions, [and] his overall persona."[37] Roshan next appeared in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's action drama Mission Kashmir (2000) alongside Sanjay Dutt, Preity Zinta, and Jackie Shroff. Set in the valley of Kashmir during the Indo-Pakistani conflicts, the film addressed the topics of terrorism and crime, and was a financial success.[28] Roshan was drawn to his complex role of a young man traumatised by the discovery that his adoptive father had been responsible for the death of his entire birth family.[34] In Adarsh's opinion, Roshan "brightens up the screen with his magnetic presence. His body language, coupled with his expressions, is sure to win him plaudits."[38]</p>
